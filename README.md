# Welcome to my TURandom App!

This is an app for the GIS exercise. It is a simple nextjs application that gets user data from the [https://randomuser.me/api](https://randomuser.me/) api but with a towson themed UI.

# Getting Started

```h
node -v // to check node
npm -v // tp check npm
```

Then open the project and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install package.json
```

Then run the development environment:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and you'll be able to use the app!
